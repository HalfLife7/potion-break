## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
<p>Games can be quite addicting! Even when you have an important deadline coming up, you might not be to resist slaying the next dragon or getting new loot.</p>

<p>By committing to pay a charity 'x' amount of dollars if you fail to take a break from playing, it might give you that extra bit of motivation you need to resist playing.</p>

<p>**Note that Potion Break is still in testing and no real money is involved! Use test cards such as '4242 4242 4242 4242' for testing.</p>

<p>3 Steps to Potion Break:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Customize your Potion Break - Options include game, charity and duration</li>
  <li>Go AFK! - Spend your extra time learning a new hobby, studying for that test or playing some basketball.</li>
  <li>Sucessfully take a break? Save your hard earned cash.<br>Give in to temptation? Lose your money to the charity of your choice</li>
</ol>

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
```
    $ npm install npm -g
